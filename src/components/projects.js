        description: "Micro aerial vehicles and their abilities have rapidly evolved in recent years. The ability to interact with their environment, known as aerial manipulation, is a par- ticularly new field of drone research. Most existing solutions of aerial manipulators utilize commercially available multirotors as a base platform, which are then suit- ably modified for manipulation. In contrast, project Griffin aimed to develop a fully integrated aerial manipulator design from scratch. It features a linear delta arm built into the structural part of the flying platform. To achieve omnidirectionality, four tiltable propeller groups were utilized. A key idea of using a linear delta ma- nipulator is the ability of the robot manipulator to compensate positional errors of the platform. During the project, the concept was successfully verified by grasping and releasing an object from above and from the side and demonstrating omnidi- rectional flight. The position of the end-effector was shown to be more accurate compared to a hypothetical fixed end-effector on the platform. The final result is a full proof of concept of an integrated omnidirectional aerial manipulator.",

        skills: "HTML, React.js, Tailwind CSS",
        description: "In this bachelor thesis, a motion planner for the omnidirectional aerial manipulator PrisMAV is implemented. The optimization-based planner builds on the Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning (CHOMP) algorithm to enable motion planning for omnidirectional micro aerial vehicles (OMAVs). CHOMP enables the computation of smooth and collision-free trajectories through the optimization of an initial (potentially infeasible) trajectory, such as a straight line path. An additional cost function on the orientation of PrisMAV was designed to encourage flight in energy efficient flight modes. \n The planner is tested and verified in simulation under different scenarios where rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) serve as a performance benchmark. We observe clearly longer flight periods spent in favourable orientations for trajectories produced by our planner and a noticeable decrease in trajectory length compared to RRT.",
